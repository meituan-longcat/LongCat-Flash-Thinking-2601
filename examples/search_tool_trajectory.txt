/think_on <longcat_assistant><longcat_think>
Got it, let's figure out this question step by step. First, the user is asking for the main civilian airport of the capital city of China's only tropical province. 

First, I need to confirm which province in China is the only tropical one. I remember that Hainan is the southernmost province, and it's tropical. Let me verify that with a search to be sure.

Okay, so the search results confirm that Hainan is China's only tropical province (specifically, an island province). Now, what's the capital city of Hainan? I think it's Haikou. Let me check that quickly to be sure.

Great, so the capital of Hainan is Haikou. Now, what's the main civilian airport in Haikou? I think it's Haikou Meilan International Airport. Let me confirm that with a search to be sure.

Impeccable, the search results confirm that Haikou Meilan International Airport is the main civilian airport serving Haikou, the capital of Hainan (China's only tropical province). Let me just double-check the Wikipedia page to make sure it's the primary one. Wait, the snippet says it's the largest and busiest in Hainan, and the primary international airport for Haikou. That should be the answer. So putting it all together: the main civilian airport is Haikou Meilan International Airport.
